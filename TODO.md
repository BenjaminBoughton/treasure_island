# Treasure Island Family Tree - TODO

## Current Status
✅ Successfully implemented radial family tree with center circle and four outer sections
✅ Added Jim Carruthers as additional spouse with proper positioning and rotation  
✅ Created subdivision within Emily's section with vertical line
✅ Clean visual hierarchy showing chronological marriage order

## Next Steps

### 1. Refine Multiple Spouses - Better Way to Visualize?
- Current approach works but could be improved
- Consider alternative layouts for multiple marriages
- Better visual indicators for divorce/remarriage

### 2. Work on Next Level (Third Generation)
- Add children of the current four couples
- Expand to show grandchildren of James & Sarah
- Maintain radial structure with additional concentric circles

### 3. Generalize! 
- **Critical**: This will be 6 generations, we cannot be hardcoding in variables as name
- Needs to be easy to add a child generation
- Create data-driven approach instead of hardcoded sections
- Build flexible system for adding new family members
- Consider JSON data structure for family tree data

## Technical Improvements
- Make the visualization data-driven
- Create reusable functions for adding generations
- Implement dynamic positioning algorithms
- Add configuration options for different layouts
